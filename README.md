# COS 426 Final Project: Cat Dash

Cat dash is an endless runner game. Players use left and right arrow keys to control the cat avoid obstacles and collect flowers!

The flying speed and density of obstacles increase as the game goes on to make it more challenging and thrilling.

## Installation
To build this project, you will need to use GitHub's NodeJS Package Manager (npm) to manage and install project dependencies. All npm settings, as well as your project dependencies and their versionings, are defined in the file `package.json`. 

The NodeJS Package Manager, which is the world's largest software registry and supports over one million open source JavaScript packages and libraries, runs in a NodeJS runtime. The NodeJS runtime is essentially a port of Google Chrome's JavaScript V8 engine that will run directly in your terminal (instead of within a browser).

Before you begin, you will need to install [NodeJS and npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). Then, open a new terminal instance, set your working directory to the root of the project, and run `npm install`.

## Launching a Local Webserver
Now that your development environment is ready to go, you can spin up a local development webserver using `npm start`. This command will bundle the project code and start a development server at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). Visit this in your web browser; every time you make changes to the code, *the page will automatically refresh!*
